# rejected-university-application

## Overview; Why I Started This
This project aims to automate follow-up emails for university application rejections. Powered by OpenAI APIs and built with Node.js, this email bot utilizes disposable email addresses with SMTPs to send automated pleas for reconsideration.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project stems from the frustration of receiving university application rejections and the desire to prove my development skills. By automating the follow-up process, I hope to increase the chances of receiving specific feedback, guidance, and reconsideration from the admissions committee.

## Key Features
- Integration with OpenAI APIs for generating personalized email content.
- Utilization of disposable email addresses and SMTPs for sending emails anonymously.
- Customizable email templates to cater to different rejection scenarios.
- Error handling and logging mechanisms to ensure smooth operation.
- Simple and intuitive setup process for easy deployment.
